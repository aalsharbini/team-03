# Code of Conduct
* How work will flow:
    * Work will often be divided and assigned to certain individuals depending on task size. 
    * BaseCamp board will be utilzied to manage tasks and assign them to specific people. 
    * Work will flow in order of priority and the deadlines for requirements we are to complete for each Sprint. 
    * Work will be completed on a timely basis or with a clear effort made towards an appropiate deadline.

* Communication rules and methods:
    * Communication is to be completed using the team created Discord channel, if this communication fails:   
        * Individuals are able to be reached via email and/or phone number for important situations.
    * All memebers are responsible for communicating issues and/or conflicts with the rest of the group.
    * Despite our roles, everyone will work together, just because a job does not necessarily pertain to you, does not mean you are not able to aid.

* Consequences
    * No participation or communication for more than a couple of days (3-5) is not acceptable, upon absence from any group activity you will be reported and dropped from the group.
    * In this project, each member will participate equally.

* Restoration Methods
    * Assess the situation: Start by identifying the root cause of the failure and determine what went wrong. This can help you come up with a plan for moving forward.  
    * Focus on learning: Instead of dwelling on the failure, focus on what can be learned from the experience. Encourage team members to identify areas where they can improve their skills and knowledge.
    * Redefine success: After a failure, it's important to redefine success. This could mean adjusting goals, timelines, or budget to ensure that future projects are more likely to succeed.
	* Set achievable goals: Set achievable goals for the future and break the project down into smaller, manageable steps. This can help team members feel more in control and confident about moving forward.
