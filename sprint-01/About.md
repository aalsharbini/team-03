# About.md

IT For Hire is a webpage loosely based off "Angie's List" AKA "Angi" that allows you to hire professionals in certain labor areas for any size project you may need. On our page, consumer's will be able to hire IT professionals for any task that they made need such as Security, UX Design, Coding, etc. Our webpage is essentially a large database of independent contractors available for hire, listing themselves as services and providing details about themselves professionally to appeal to the consumer. Our page will contain basic features those most related to ecommerce sites, including but not limited to, account createion, shopping cart management (to book a contractor), payment features, etc. Additionally, there will be business specific pages such as Careers, About Us, Legal Notices, etc. 

IT For Hire was generated as our idea as we understand how hard it is to sometimes find IT professinals in the industry that are able to perform these often "free-lance" jobs, easily and fast. IT For Hire will allow from short-term to long-term contracts and ideally can help find a professional fit for any IT job. IT For Hire combines the ease of use from Angie's List, database aspects from Indeed/LinkedIn, and overall service booking aspects from any professional hiring site. 

This is our general plan for the site, thank you.
